# Match Checker

## Introduction
**Match Checker** is a robust and efficient string matching tool designed to determine the percentage match between two strings. Leveraging the power of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), this project implements the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm to deliver fast and reliable results.

## Problem Domain
In various applications such as plagiarism detection, text comparison, and search engines, determining the similarity between strings is crucial. The Match Checker addresses this problem by calculating how closely a given string matches another. It provides a percentage-based match result, making it user-friendly and precise.

### Key Features:
- Efficient string comparison using Rabin-Karp algorithm.
- Clear percentage-based output for string similarity.
- Easy-to-use web interface.

---

## Solution Domain
Match Checker solves the problem of string similarity by:
1. Implementing the Rabin-Karp algorithm, a rolling hash-based method, for efficient substring matching.
2. Providing an interactive web interface using Python (Django) for backend logic and HTML/CSS for frontend design.
3. Allowing users to input strings and get immediate similarity results in a user-friendly format.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following technologies and tools are required:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Algorithm**: Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm

## Methodology
1. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The Rabin-Karp algorithm is used to compute the hash values of substrings and compare them efficiently to identify matches.

2. **Web Application Development**:
   - Backend logic is implemented using Python and Django.
   - A user-friendly interface is designed with HTML and CSS.

3. **Workflow**:
   - User inputs two strings via the web interface.
   - The backend processes the inputs using the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
   - The percentage match is calculated and displayed to the user.
